# Binary Hawk Dotfiles

These dotfiles are intended to be used for quick and easy setup of the environment for all Binary Hawk stuff.
This way, we can have a consistent prompt (&c) on all boxes, both remote and local. There should also be a script
sooner or later that can be run on a freshly cloned repository to run all of the files appropriately.
